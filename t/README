The tree of test data created by test_create_test_tree() found in
the testlib looks as follows:

                1
      __________|__________
     |          |          |
    1.1 "a"    1.2 "b"    1.3 "c"
                      _____|_____
                     |           |
                   1.3.1 "d"   1.3.2 "e"
                     |
                  1.3.1.1 "f"

Changing that tree will likely require tweaks to the tests that
make assumptions about its structure.
