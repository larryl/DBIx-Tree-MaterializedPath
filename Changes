Revision history for DBIx-Tree-MaterializedPath

0.06    2008-11-25
        Changed fetchall_arrayref to return array of arrays,
            instead of array of hashrefs, resulting in a 20-30%
            speedup for some operations on large trees.
        Minor POD tweaks.

0.05    2008-11-24
        API change: Changed D::T::MP::Node->get_descendants() to
            return a D::T::MP::TreeRepresentation object instead
            of a raw data structure.  Removed
            Node->traverse_descendants() in favor of
            TreeRepresentation->traverse().
        Minor POD tweaks.

0.04    2008-11-22
        Changed an unpack() format template in D::T::MP::PathMapper
            that was not working in Perl 5.6.1 because of
            parenthesis grouping.
        Added DBI to Build.PL 'requires' to avoid erroneous fail
            reports from CPANtesters.
        Minor POD tweaks.

0.03    2008-11-22
