DBIx-Tree-MaterializedPath

DBIx::Tree::MaterializedPath - fast DBI queries and updates on "materialized path" trees

This module implements database storage for a "materialized path"
parent/child tree.

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build test --verbose   (if any of the t/* tests fail)
    ./Build install          (if the tests look okay)

TESTING

The test harness currently requires DBD::SQLite to run.  Additional
DBD drivers (and corresponding DSNs) can be added to the file:
"t/testlib/testutils.pm".  The driver will need to support some
sort of autoincrement or trigger for primary key values.
